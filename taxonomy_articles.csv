density-based outlier detection approach with local kernel   density estimation (kde). a relative density-based outlier score (rdos) is introduced to measure local   outlierness of objects, in which the density distribution at the location of an object is estimated with   a local kde method based on extended nearest neighbors of the object. instead of using only k nearest   neighbors, we further consider reverse nearest neighbors and shared nearest neighbors of an object for   density distribution estimation. some theoretical properties of the proposed rdos including its expected   value and false alarm probability are derived. a comprehensive experimental study on both synthetic and   real-life data sets demonstrates that our approach is more effective than state-of-the-art outlier detection   © 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.   advances in data acquisition have created massive collections  f data, capturing valuable information to science, government,  usiness, and society. however, despite of the availability of large  mount of data, some events are rare or exceptional, which are  sually called “outliers” or “anomalies”. compared with many  ther knowledge discovery problems, outlier detection is some imes more valuable in many applications, such as network in rusion detection, fraudulent transactions, and medical diagnos ics. for example, in network intrusion detection, the number of  ntrusions or attacks (“bad” connections) is much less than the  good” and normal connections. similarly, the abnormal behaviors  re usually rare in many other cases. although these outliers are  nly a small portion of the whole data set, it is much more costly  o misunderstand them compared with other events.   in recent decades, many outlier detection approaches have been  roposed. usually an outlier detection method can be catego ized into the following four types of method [1,2] : distribution ased, distance-based, clustering-based, and density-based. in  istribution-based methods, an object is considered as the outlier  f it deviates from a standard distribution (e.g., normal, poisson,  mong others) too much [3] . the problem of the distribution-based  ethod is that the underlying distribution is usually unknown and ∗ corresponding author.  e-mail addresses: bo.tang@hofstra.edu (b. tang), he@ele.uri.edu ,   url:

many practi the distance-based methods detect outliers by computing dis ances among all objects. an object is considered as the outlier  hen it has d 0 distance away from p 0 percentage of objects in the  ata set [4] . the distances among objects need to be calculated  n either raw data space or feature subspace. for high dimensional  ata sets, feature reduction is usually needed before calculating the  istance [5] . to detect local outliers in a data set with multiple  omponents or clusters, a topn k th nearest neighbor distance is  roposed [6] , in which the distance from an object to its k th near st neighbor indicates outlierness of the object. the cluster-based  ethods detect outliers in the process of finding clusters. the ob ect does not belong any cluster is considered as the outlier [7–9] .   in density-based methods, an outlier is detected when its local  ensity differs from its neighborhood. different density estimation  ethods can be applied to measure the density. for example, lo al outlier factor (lof) [10] is an outlierness score indicating how  n object differs from its locally reachable neighborhood. following  tudies [11] have shown that it is more reliable to consider those  bjects who have the highest lof scores as outliers, instead of  omparing the lof score with a threshold. lately, several variations  f the lof have been proposed [12,13] . a local distance-based out ier factor (ldof) using the relative distance from an object to its  eighbors is proposed for outlier detection in scattered datasets  12] , and a influenced outlierness (inflo) score is proposed with  he consideration of both neighbors and reverse neighbors of an  bject when estimating its relative density distribution [13] . con idering underlying patterns of the data, tang et. al. proposed a 172 b. tang, h. he / neurocomputing 241 (2017) 171–180   fig. 1. three types of nearest neighbors considered. arrows from x i and x j to   nn r ( x i ) and nn s ( x j ), respectively.   connectivity-based outlier factor (cof) scheme [14] . while all these  lof-based and cof-based outlier detection methods measure the  relative distribution through distance, several other density-based  methods have been proposed based on kernel density estimation  [15–17] . for example, local density factor (ldf) [15] is proposed  by extending the lof with kernel density estimation. similar to  the loci, a relative density score termed kdeos [17] is calculated  using kernel density estimation and applies the z score transfor mation for score normalization.   in this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based  on the local kernel density estimation for robust local outlier de tection. instead of using the whole data set, the density of an ob ject is estimated with the objects in its neighborhood. three kinds  of neighbors: k nearest neighbors, reverse nearest neighbors, and  shared nearest neighbors, are considered in our local kernel den sity estimation. our motivation behind using these three types of  nearest neighbors is from the success of connectivity-based outlier  factor [14] and extended nearest neighbors methods [18] . these  three types of nearest neighbors contain different connectivity in formation, which allows our method to be flexible to model differ ent local patterns of normal data. a simple and effective relative  density calculation, termed relative density-based outlier score  (rdos), is introduced to measure the outlierness. theoretical prop erties of the rdos, including the expected value and the false  alarm probability are derived, which suggests parameter settings  in practical applications. we further employ the topn scheme to  rank the objects with their outlierness, i.e., the objects with the  highest rdos are considered as the outliers. simulation results on  both synthetic data sets and real-life data sets illustrate superior  performance of our proposed method. we note that the most sim ilar work to ours are the robust kernel-based outlier factor (rkof)  [16] , which is a ratio of weighted density estimate of its neighbors  to its local density estimate, and the kdeos [17] , which uses a z  score of local density estimate. however, for a given object, unlike  both rkof and rkof, we use an extended relative local density es timate as outlier score, considering its nearest neighbors, reverse  nearest neighbors, and shared nearest neighbors. in ",2017-03-08T17:15:20Z,10,"[('1D CNN based network intrusion detection with normalization on imbalanced data', 'IEEE'),

2,A Novel Semi-Supervised Learning Approach for Network Intrusion Detection on Cloud-Based Robotic System,"special section on cloud-based robotic systems for intelligent services  received july 27, 2018, accepted august 24, 2018, date of publication september 13, 2018, date of current version october 8, 2018.  digital object identifier 10.1109/access.2018.2868171  a novel semi-supervised learning approach for network intrusion detection on cloud-based robotic system ying gao, yu liu , yaqia jin, juequan chen, and hongrui wu department of computer science and engineering, south china university of technology, guangzhou 510006, china  corresponding authors: ying gao (gaoying@scut.edu.cn) and yu liu (350268634@qq.com)  this work was supported in part by the guangzhou people’s livelihood science and technology project under grant 201803010097 and in part by the guangzhou key industrial technology project under grant 201802020014 and grant 201802010035.  abstract although the cloud-based robotic system has provided the services in various industries, its data safety is continuously threatened, and the network intrusion detection system (nids) is considered as a necessary component to ensure its security. in recent years, many machine learning (ml) techniques have been applied for building a more intelligent nids. most nidss based on the ml method and artificial intelligence techniques are either supervised or unsupervised. however, the supervised learning for nids depends much on the labeled data. this weakness makes it harder to detect the latest attack patterns. meanwhile, the unsupervised learning for nids often fails to give the satisfactory results. therefore, this paper proposed a novel fuzziness-based semi-supervised learning approach via ensemble learning for network intrusion detection on the cloud-based robotic system, which can address the above issues. first, due to the good generalization ability of ensemble learning, we construct an ensemble system trained by the labeled data. moreover, for better utilizing the unlabeled data, a fuzziness-based method is adopted for data analysis. in this way, the noisy and redundant examples in the data set are removed. finally, we use the same ensemble approach to combine both supervised and unsupervised parts. to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the nids, the proposed approach is tested on thensl-kdddata set, which is a commonly used traffic data set. the experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves the accuracy 84.54% and 71.29% on the, respectively, ‘‘kddtest+’’ and ‘‘kddtest-21’’ data sets. when compared with the stateof-the-art method, the proposed method also delivers a promising result.  index terms intrusion detection, clouds, robotic system, artificial intelligence (ai), semi-supervised learning.  i.

significant amounts of information to intruders and attackers. firewalls aim to detect violations according to a predefined rule-set and usually block potentially dangerous incoming traffic. however, with the evolution of attack techniques, it is more difficult to distinguish anomalies from normal traffic. different detection approaches have been proposed, including the use of machine learning techniques based on neural models such as self-organizing maps (soms). in this paper, we present a classification approach that hybridizes statistical techniques and som for network anomaly detection. thus, while principal component analysis (pca) and fisher discriminant ratio (fdr) have been considered for feature selection and noise removal, probabilistic self-organizing maps (psom) aim to model the feature space and enable distinguishing between normal and anomalous connections. the detection capabilities of the proposed system can be modified without retraining the map, but only by modifying the units activation probabilities. this deals with fast implementations of intrusion detection systems (ids) necessary to cope with current link bandwidths.  & 2015 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.  nowadays, with the growth of internet, not only the number of interconnected computers, but also the relevance of network applications, has increased considerably. at the same time, the trend to online services has exposed sensitive information to intruders and attackers [16,3]. common protection approaches do not react to attackers or intruders, but only suppose a passive position to reduce exposure. on the other hand, the complexity of the newer attacks necessitates the use of elaborated techniques, such as pattern classification or artificial intelligence, for successfully detecting an attack or just to differentiate among normal and anomalous traffic. other approaches that implement an active protection against real or potential attackers include firewall-like systems capable of inspecting data packets. ids and intrusion protection systems (ips) are active systems that continuously monitor the network. these systems calculate some features from the monitored network in order to classify the traffic, detect abnormal behaviours and react according to predefined rules. this presents a classification problem, with some requirements  needing specific approaches, thus contributing to the machine learning field.  there are two ids design approaches [3,15,27,17] depending on the detection philosophy. the first is the so-called signature-based ids [27], which analyses all the incoming packets looking for known patterns associated with intrusion attempts. these patterns are stored in a database and can be compared with patterns extracted from incoming network traffic. in other words, signature-based ids works similarly to virus scanners as they also compare observed behaviours with stored ones. however, this method is not able to detect attacks whose signature is not in the database. similarly, outdated databases or deficient signatures may cause false negatives or false positives (that is, missing an actual attack or misreading legitimate traffic as an attacker). the second searches for deviations from normal patterns to decide whether a connection is classified as anomalous, namely anomaly-based [17]. these systems usually characterize normal patterns by means of statistical learning techniques applied to network traffic. in addition, using complex features allows discovering not only an actual intrusion, but also a potential one, namely anomaly-based ids. nevertheless, in anomalybased systems, sufficiently accurate models are necessary to distinguish normal from abnormal patterns. otherwise, the ids is likely to generate too many false positives or negatives. anomaly-based ids can be addressed, for instance, by discovering a misuse of the protocol flags or an abnormal number of certain events (such as the

detection.  in the last years, different intrusion detection approaches have been proposed, including the use of artificial intelligence techniques, such as neural networks [55].  as explained in the next section, anomaly detection is not a straightforward task in a real environment [42,29,49,15] and poses interesting problems related to classification and feature selection.  this way, datasets such as kdd99 (and also the nsl-kdd) have been built to provide training and test subsets with different statistical distributions as expected in real anomaly detection tasks. as the kdd99 is a large-volume dataset, researchers usually take random samples for their experiments that explain the discrepancies observed in the literature [58]. in [37], an analysis is provided of the low level of industry adoption of intrusion detection procedures proposed in the academic literature, despite their reported high performance. among those reasons, incorrect feature selection procedures and statistical analysis, as well as not having enough detailed experiments, are considered. in this paper, the ids concerns expressed in [37] have been taken into account and addressed.  in this work, principal component analysis (pca) is used to generate a new set of non-correlated features in order to remove noise and to avoid using low variance variables (that is, almost single-valued variables). moreover, these new features are selected according to their discriminative capability. subsequently, feature space modelling and classification is addressed by means of probabilistic som, a fuzzy version of classical som that allows measuring the activation probability of each unit. nevertheless, detecting not only an attack but also the type is not a straightforward task, and previous approaches have not been able to obtain high per attack detection accuracy values [42,29].  the rest of the paper describes the databases and methods used in this work, and the experimental results. specifically, section 2 is split into three subsections, feature filtering and selection procedures (sections 2.1 and 2.2), and the use of probabilistic som for modelling and classification (section 2.3). then section 3 describes the dataset used for the experiments and the feature selection accomplished to distinguish between anomalies and normal traffic. finally, section 4 analyses the previous work done in this line and section 5 summarizes the conclusions of the paper.  the proposed feature selection and classification method for anomaly detection is presented in this section, which has been split into three subsections that summarize our approach. fig. 1 shows its corresponding block diagram.  2.1. feature generation and pca filtering  feature selection is a key step in classification problems as it contributes to removing redundant or irrelevant input features not only to reduce computing times for learning, but also to improve classifier accuracy [58]. the methods for feature selection can be classified into filter, wrapper and hybrid methods. filter methods select the feature subset as a pre-processing step according to a chosen criterion and without taking into account the performance of the classifier. thus, filter methods are usually less computational than expensive wrapper methods that use the classification outcomes to evaluate the feature selection methods. although wrapper methods usually outperform filter methods with respect to classifier accuracy, the results obtained are usually not applicable whenever the classifier is changed. thus, there are proposals  (that is, hybrid methods) that combine a wrapper method with a filter that guides the classifier. the approach considered in this paper can be included in the filter methods.  principal component analysis (pca) has been widely used in many applications for extracting the most relevant dataset information. in fact, it has been successfully used in face recognition applications [51]. in this case, pca is used to derive a new set of uncorrelated features from a set of correlated ones. thus, pca generates a set of orthogonal basis vectors so that the data can be expressed as a linear combination of that basis. some papers [14] have claimed that this method presents some classification task problems as it requires more processing whenever new data is added and it is not invariant under a transformation of the data.  the procedure can be explained as follows. let x ¼ fx1;…; xnt g, xi ¼ ðx1i ;…; xni þ  t be the input data samples (training samples). a shifted version of the data manifold can be obtained by subtracting the mean (x ), y ¼ x�x , where yiarn, yi ¼ ðy1i ;…; yni þ  t , i¼ 1;…;nt . pca searches for nt orthonormal vectors uk ¼ ðu1k ;…;unk þ; k¼ 1;…;nt such that  is maximum. vectors uk, k¼ 1;…;nt verify that utl uk ¼ δlk (δlk is the kronecker delta). vectors uk and scalars λk are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, respectively, of the covariance matrix computed as c ¼ yyt . it is worth noting the difference between the presented method and the eigenconnections approach [5], inspired by the face recognition method using eigenvectors (eigenfaces) [51] due to its appearance. in this case, eigenvectors are used to generate a new feature space that allows us to remove noise comprising the discriminative information in a reduced number of features. thus, the training data samples are projected onto the space spanned by the eigenvectors to generate a set of uncorrelated features that best describe the data manifold. these features are further used to train the som-based classifier described in this section. in order to classify a new data instance v, it has to be projected onto the eigenvectors space, obtaining its corresponding feature vector:  on the other hand, the original data can be reconstructed from the principal components as  where vk rec is the reconstruction of v using the eigenvector k.  although in the problem considered in this work, the two first principal components account for more than 95 percent of the variance, it does not ensure the discriminative capability of the projections. thus, selected eigenvectors are sorted by their  fig. 1. block diagram of the proposed anomaly detection system.  e. de la hoz et al. / neurocomputing 164 (2015) 71–8172 discriminative power according to their fisher discriminant ratio (fdr) value, as is explained in what follows.  2.2. fisher discriminant ratio for eigenvectors selection  in many problems (such as in nsl-kdd classification), the data set is noisy and contains columns with single or almost single values. moreover, other columns containing not single values are not discriminative enough, contain redundant or not relevant information and result in misclassification. for this reason, a preprocessing stage to filter the input data is necessary [23,8]. although pca sorts the principal components by its associated variance (eigenvalue), it is not guaranteed that eigenvectors with higher eigenvalues are the most discriminative ones. this can be solved by selecting the principal components according to the fdr criterion using the following method:  let x ¼ fx1;…; xnt g be the training samples, y their shifted versions and u ¼ fu1;…;ung the eigenvectors matrix. a new training dataset can be derived from x by projecting it into each eigenvector. thus, defining  ψ i ¼ uti nx ð4þ each column ψi in ψ¼ fψ1;…;ψng corresponds to the projection of x into the eigenvector ui. as pca sorts the eigenvectors according to a decreasing variance order, first eigenvectors comprise the most part of the variance. however, it does not ensure a good enough class separation capability. this way, eigenvectors are ordered according to their fdr value:  for the multi-class case, where σi, μi are the variance and mean for the class i, respectively. eq. (5) can be simplified to  for the 2 class separation case. our purpose is to remove noise from the dataset while using  only the eigenvectors with maximum class separation capabilities. this is achieved by selecting projections that provide the r lower fdr values, and subtracting the reconstructing of the samples using these eigenvectors from the original dataset, as indicated in the following equation:  algorithm 1. pca–fdr feature selection method.  1. subtract the mean from the training samples: y ¼ x�x . 2. compute the principal components ui  t verifying eq. (12) (section 2.3).  3. compute the projection ψi of the training samples onto the eigenvectors according to eq. (4).  4. sort the eigenvectors according to the discriminative power of the projections according to their fdr value.  5. subtract the projection of the training samples onto the eigenvectors with lower fdr values from the data manifold as indicated in eq. (7).  the method described above has been summarized in the pseudocode shown in algorithm 1. a variant of this method has been used in [31,2]. the filtered dataset x̂ contains the same number of features as x, but their noise corresponds to the least  discriminant eigenvectors. subsequently, the filtered dataset is projected into the k eigenvectors with the higher fdr value (that is, the most discriminative eigenvectors), thus reducing the dataset dimension to k. this way, the described method allows selecting the k most discriminative eigenvectors and, subsequently, computing the features from attacks that enable their adequate classification.  2.3. classification using bayesian som  som [26] is one of the most popular neural network models for unsupervised learning. som groups similar data instances into a 2d or 3d lattice, namely, an output map. on the other hand, different data instances will be apart in the output map. moreover, some important input space properties can be inferred from that output map [20].  1. input space modelling. the prototypesωi (where ðiþ refers to the unit index in the map) computed during the som training provide an approximation of the input space.  2. topological order. units on the output map are arranged into a 2d or 3d lattice, and their position depends on the specific input space features. this way, the index of a unit could be expressed as tuples ði1; i2þ or ði1; i2; i3þ, respectively for 2d or 3d lattices.  3. feature selection. the som algorithm produces a number of prototypes from the input data space. thus, the algorithm not only reduces the dimension, but also the input space size, as it is represented by the prototype vectors.  the som algorithm is briefly explained in what follows. let x arn be a n-dimensional data manifold. the som map is composed of d units, each represented by an n-dimensional model vector ωi. for each input data instance v, the best matching unit (bmu) is defined as the unit ωi closest to v:  jωi�vjr jωj�vj ; 8vax; ia j ð8þ  where j � j is the euclidean distance and x is the training dataset. once the bmu is determined for the current iteration, the model vectors are updated according to the rule:  ωiðtþ1þ ¼ωiðtþþαðtþhiðtþðv�ωiðtþþ ð9þ where αðtþ is the learning rate and hi(t) is a function that defines the neighbourhood around the bmu ωi. usually,  1 αðtþ diminishes following an exponential decay rule [26] and hi is a gaussian [26] hat whose width shrinks in time (iterations). in this work, the som has been initialized linearly as follows in order to avoid random effects [26]. linear som prototype initialization aims to accommodate the training data eigenvalues and eigenvectors [26,1,52]. this initialization method implies that the first dimension of the prototypes was arranged proportionally to the first principal component and that the second dimension was arranged proportionally to the second principal component. for example, in 2d maps, the initial values of the prototype vector with coordinates ði1; i2þ on the output map were determined by eq. (10), which defines the centroid of the subspace along the two principal input data components:2  1 note that i is a linear index that identify the prototype vectors. 2 note that ði1 ; i2þ is the subscript that identifies the prototype vector with  e. de la hoz et al. / neurocomputing 164 (2015) 71–81 73 in eq. (10) x is the average vector of the input data along each dimension, σ1 is the standard deviation of the first principal component, nd1 and nd2 are the number of units on the first and second map dimensions, respectively, and pc1 and pc2 are the first and second principal components of the input data, respectively.  once the map is already trained, each prototype represents a set of input vectors (those input vectors that activate this vector as their bmu). in other words, som quantizes the data manifold in d n-dimensional prototypes or model vectors. this learning model activates a specific unit (that is, the corresponding bmu) whenever a new data instance is presented to the som.  however, it is possible to measure the response of the map units instead of calculating the bmu as the unit that is closest to the input data. this way, a probabilistic interpretation of the som could be obtained by modelling the prototypes using a gaussian mixture model (gmm), which fuzzifies the som unit response [1]. the main goal behind using a gmm is to train the map only once, while a further tuning of the map response (that is, the classification results) can be achieved by modifying the prior activation probabilities of the som units such that they allow the activation level to be used to recognize the corresponding patterns associated to normal connections and network anomalies in this case. thus, anomalies can be detected as they deviate from the normal activation patterns [45]. in this probabilistic som, the bmu is determined not only by computing the minimum distance to a given input vector, but also by taking into account the likelihood of an unit to be the bmu. the prior probability of each map unit i can be experimentally computed by taking into account the training set activation probability similarly to [1], as it is shown in the following equation:  where # ~x is the total number of input vectors and # ~xi is the number of vectors whose closest prototype is ωi, as defined in eq. (12) (voronoi set of unit i). this is also called the receptive field of unit i [48]:  ~xi ¼ fxax=jx�ωi jr jx�ωk j k¼ 1;…n; iakg ð12þ  where x is the set of training patterns. the gmm is built according to eq. (13) using n components  (one for each som prototype), where the weights pi for each  gaussian component corresponds to the prior probabilities computed in eq. (11):  in eq. (13), piðxþ is an n-dimensional gaussian distribution [1,46] that serves as prototype vector and is computed as  piðxþ ¼ 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi  the mean of each individual gaussian component μi, is the prototype vector of the corresponding unit itself, while the covariance matrix σ i for the i-component is given by the dispersion of the data samples around the model vector ωi. in other words, each gaussian component models the distribution of the receptive field of the corresponding unit. once the gmm model has been built, the response of the unit k for a given input x can be computed as the posterior probability by using the bayes theorem:  consequently, in eq. (15), pðωk jxþ represents the probability that a sample vector x belongs to class ωk (posterior probability), pðxjωkþ is the probability density function of the prototype ωk computed from the gmm according to eq. (13) (that is, pk(x)) and pðxþ is a normalization constant that makes the posterior probability density integrate equal to one and thus can be computed as  where nc is the number of classes. fig. 2 shows the a priori activation probabilities, pi, for each  map unit. in addition, normal connections are mapped in units represented as circles, while network anomalies are mapped in units represented as squares.  3. experimental setup and results  in this section, the database used to assess the proposed method and the experimental results obtained are presented. the issues vis–vis assuring correct experimental conclusions as described in [37] deal with: a detailed description of the dataset used as benchmark, including the training and testing sets that should be properly defined. a cross-validation performed by using the testing set to evaluate the ips that has learnt by using the training set. the number of evaluation executions should guarantee statistical validity according to the central limit theorem. the evaluation metrics that should be considered. the use of the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve alone, or detection rate and false positive rate could be incomplete [37], and the use of area under roc curve (auc) in combination with roc curve and accuracy would be interesting. the need for analysing different types of attacks separately.  in this paper, we use a revised version of the kdd99 dataset [37], which has been widely used in research works and contains about 4gb of compressed data from captures of tcpdump [30] in the darpa98 ids evaluation program [33]. this data corresponds to about seven weeks of network traffic, and three groups of features extracted for each connection. darpa datasets [35] were generated in 1998, 1999 and 2000 in mit lincoln laboratories, specifically for testing purposes. the sets consist of simulated host and network normal traffic and manually generated network fig. 2. som a priori logarithmic activation probabilities for each unit computed according to eq. (11), that is, log ð# ~xi =# ~x þ. circles and squares represent the label of each unit, corresponding to normal connections and network anomalies, respectively.  e. de la hoz et al. / neurocomputing 164 (2015) 71–8174 based attacks [49]. training and testing subsets provided by the kdd99 dataset follow different probability distributions.  however, the kdd99 dataset has inherent representation problems due to the synthetic characteristic of the data [33,37]. thus, the network security lab—knowledge discovery and data mining (nsl-kdd) dataset [38] was proposed to overcome most of the deficiencies of kdd99, as stated in [33]. moreover, in nsl-kdd, redundant records were removed and the attacks were labelled and sorted by their level of detection difficulty. then, as in the most recent works [22,40,39], we also use the nsl-kdd dataset. moreover, in nsl-kdd, redundant records in kdd99 were removed and the attacks labelled and sorted by their level of detection difficulty. taking into account all these characteristics, the nsl-kdd can be considered a good approximation to present known attacks. this way, nsl-kdd constitutes an adequate dataset to evaluate our procedure as the most recent ids reference works [18,40,39,54,28].  as kdd'99, the nsl-kdd dataset provides 41 features extracted from the network traffic to describe each connection. these features can be grouped into four types:  1. basic features. these features summarize all the properties of a tcp/ip connection.  2. traffic-based features. this class includes those features computed over a time interval (window) and contains information about the connections in which the destination port or the service remains the same after the corresponding time windows. in the kdd99, the time window is two seconds.  3. content-based features. since u2r or r2l attacks consist of repeatedly sending similar patterns on the packet payload, it is necessary to examine the contents of the packets to figure out these attacks.  indeed, these features are used to classify the attacks enumerated in the ",2015-05-13T05:22:32Z,11,"[('1D CNN based network intrusion detection with normalization on imbalanced

 received: 27 december 2019; accepted: 29 january 2020; published: 5 february 2020 ���������� �������  abstract: since svm is sensitive to noises and outliers of system call sequence data. a new fuzzy support vector machine algorithm based on svdd is presented in this paper. in our algorithm, the noises and outliers are identified by a hypersphere with minimum volume while containing the maximum of the samples. the definition of fuzzy membership is considered by not only the relation between a sample and hyperplane, but also relation between samples. for each sample inside the hypersphere, the fuzzy membership function is a linear function of the distance between the sample and the hyperplane. the greater the distance, the greater the weight coefficient. for each sample outside the hypersphere, the membership function is an exponential function of the distance between the sample and the hyperplane. the greater the distance, the smaller the weight coefficient. compared with the traditional fuzzy membership definition based on the relation between a sample and its cluster center, our method effectively distinguishes the noises or outlies from support vectors and assigns them appropriate weight coefficients even though they are distributed on the boundary between the positive and the negative classes. the experiments show that the fuzzy support vector proposed in this paper is more robust than the support vector machine and fuzzy support vector machines based on the distance of a sample and its cluster center.  keywords: support vector machine; svdd; system call sequence; intrusion detection  intrusion detection systems (ids) are essential to information security. ids can be divided into signature-based ids and anomaly-based ids [1]. both are based on pattern detection. signature-based ids matches the system behavior against the known attack and lacks the ability to detect zero-day attack. anomaly-based methods construct normal behavior based on prior knowledge and judge the deviation between the current behavior and the normal behavior [2]. the advantage of the anomaly-based method is the ability to detect new attacks.  a system call requested by an application is a function built into the operation system kernel. a system call sequence is a detailed account of the system calls occurring on a host. the behavior of an application can be described in terms of the sequence of system calls. it is easy to get the system call sequence in real-time. therefore, the data of a system call sequence is often used as audit data for analysis and classification of malicious processes.  the current methods of anomaly detection are based on traditional statistics, which is the study of the asymptotic theory. that is, the limit property can be reached when the number of samples approaches infinity. in intrusion detection systems, the observation samples are limited or even a small number. this cannot satisfy the preconditions of a detection method based on traditional statistics. as a result, the false alarm rate and missing rate are high.  appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065; doi:10.3390/app10031065 www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 2 of 19  the algorithms of a system call in anomaly-based ids need a lot of data. this is because these algorithms are based on traditional statistics, which is the study of the asymptotic theory. that is, the limit property can be reached when the number of samples approaches infinity. unfortunately, the anomaly data in the intrusion detection system is very limited. therefore, we classify system calls using an svm-based algorithm, which is based on statistical learning theory. statistical learning theory makes the svm-based classifier only depend on a small part of the support vectors (svs). this is very helpful for the training of classifiers with insufficient data. svm-based algorithm, like the other algorithm, also has an inherent shortcoming, that is, it is sensitive to noises and outliers. in order to distinguish noises near the boundary from sv, fuzzy support vector machine is proposed to solve the problem. because there are no uniform guiding principles, the existing fsvm-based algorithms are inconsistent with reality when classifying system call sequences. therefore, the purpose of our paper is to construct a fuzzy support vector machine that is suitable for classifying system call sequences.  support vector machine [3–6], as a machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, derives from the idea of the dual form to solve the large dimensional problems, makes the classifier only depend on a small part of the support vectors, implements the structural risk minimization principle in statistical learning theory, and solves the problems of nonlinearity and local minima. a system call sequence can be converted into a vector in a high dimensional space by the frequency of short system call sequences of a certain length. therefore, abnormal detection can be carried out based on svm.  there are always noises and outliers in solving practical engineering applications due to statistical methods, human error and other factors. these noises and outliers cannot satisfy the precondition that all samples are independent and identically distributed. the noises and outliers near the boundary play the same role as svs in constructing the optimal classification hyperplane. to solve this problem, researchers proposed fuzzy support vector machine (fsvm), that is, different weights are assigned to different samples, so that different samples contribute differently to the optimal classification hyperplane. in order to eliminate the influence of noises and outliers, the small weights are given to these samples. the design of the membership function is the key of the whole fuzzy algorithm and is no uniform criterion to be followed. at present, there are many ways to construct a membership function. most of these methods are based on the distance between a sample and its cluster center. the closer the sample is to the cluster center, the greater the weight coefficient is. the noises and svs distributed on the boundary are far from the cluster center. they are all given less weight coefficients. this is quite different from the objective situation. svs should be given greater weight coefficients.  to solve the above problem, our paper proposed a new fuzzy support machine method based on support vector data description (svdd). the contributions of our work are as follows:  • our paper proposed a new fuzzy membership function which can effectively distinguish the noises and svs distributed on the boundary based on svdd. svs are given larger weight coefficients while noises are given smaller coefficients. in this way, our method avoids imperfection of fsvm based on the distance between a sample and its cluster center. such a fuzzy membership function structure method is more in line with reality.  • the method proposed in our paper uses the hyperplane, which passes through the cluster center and takes the line of two cluster centers as the normal vector to replace each cluster center. this is in accordance with the geometric principle of svm. in other words, two hyperplanes with maximum space are used to separate the training samples. therefore, using the hyperplane in class to replace the cluster center can better approximate the actual situation.  • our method is more efficient, especially for anomaly-based ids with high real-time requirements. in our method, the noises and outliers are identified by a sphere with minimum volume while containing the maximum of the samples. some uncontributed vectors are eliminated by pre-extracting the boundary vector set containing the support vectors. this reduces the number of training samples and speeds up the training. it is important that ids speed up detection as much as possible by reducing computation and storage. appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 3 of 19  the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, the previous work based on system calls are reviewed, while section 3 describes the proposed method. in section 4, experiments and evaluations are presented. section 5 gives some conclusions.  anomaly detection can be studied by system call sequence from different angles. these methods focus primarily on data processing, data representation and other feature selections derived from system call sequences. in this section, some methods of anomaly-based idss based on system call will be discussed.  as the original data of system call traces is large, preprocessing and feature selection methods contribute to obtaining typical features and avoiding the influence of irrelevant and redundant features on detection rate and processing cost [7,8]. methods commonly used for natural language processing are used to preprocess system call traces. the n-gram method is used to construct the system call databases of normal behavior by a sliding window with a single length or multiple lengths [9,10]. aron laszka et al. [11,12] investigated and claimed that the optimal n-gram is 6-gram in unm dataset and 7-gram in adfa-ld dataset. suaad et al. [13] continued to prove that 6-gram and 10-gram have the advantage of time efficiency and detection rate respectively in a dataset collected from a virtual machine. feature selection methods reduce redundancy and irrelevance by selecting interesting features. these methods facilitate the reduction of computation time and storage requirements, understanding data out noise and avoiding the over-fitting problem, increasing the accuracy rate. feature selection can be divided into th wrapper approach [14], filter approach [15] and hybrid approach [16] according to the correlation of algorithms. this depends on the feedback represented by the accuracy rate; the wrapper approach implements the selection of best features. the filter approach evaluates the attributes of a learning algorithm by using the statistical learning data. the wrapper approach gets better classification performance than filter approach at the expense of expensive computation. the filter approach is better suited to handle high dimensional data than the wrapper approach. a hybrid approach was produced by combining the advantages and disadvantages of the filter approach and wrapper approach.  the enumerating sequences-based [17–19] methods are simple and efficient to implement by removing system call parameters. during database construction stage, normal behaviors are represented by short system sequences. during the monitoring stage, the short sequences of testing data are obtained and tested. the enumerating sequences-based methods need constructing, updating and maintainance of the normal database for each individual program [20,21]. the murmurhash [22–24] is utilized with the bloom-filter-based method to ensure that it has the advantage over stide in terms of memory occupation, searching speed and privacy preservation. although the bloom-filter-based method shows simplicity and effectiveness, it has the limitation of false positives.  the system call sequence can be represented as a vector. qing et al. extracted a minimized set of rules to define a normal behavior and detected anomaly behavior based on a rough set [25,26]. pandit predefined workflow and added a knowledge base of workflow [27–29]. a search engine is then applied to discover the hidden knowledge [30]. the drawback of a rule-based approach [31–33], since these rules are derived from small-scale datasets, is that the rules are constantly updated. matej et al. [34] presented a new tool data collection system for windows pc. different from previously distributed data collection systems, this system uses less resources based on host and client structures. the system shows good performance in the real test environment. however, it is just a preliminary stage and is going to be a lot of work. ids plays an important role in the network. qiuhua et al. [35] proved a classification algorithm based on data clustering and data reduction by mini batch k-means algorithm in the training stage and sorting cluster in the detection stage. experiments indicated that the computational complexity was reduced significantly and the accuracy maintained high. however, the implementation of this classification method is complex. appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 4 of 19  in recent years, neural networks have made remarkable achievements in computer vision [36–38] and natural language processing [39–41]. researchers have also tried to use neural networks to process system call sequences [42–46]. anrad [47] performs probabilistic inference by self-structuring confabulation network. their network continuously refines their knowledge base and is capable of fast incremental learning. sheraz et al. [48] implemented intrusion detection in a real environment based on a convolutional neural network. in order to accelerate the training process, multiple gpus must be deployed on a physical host. the challenge of solutions based on a neural network is pricey and space consuming due to the increasing amount of data.  ambusaidi et al. [49] proved that their method contributes more critical features for the least square support vector machine to achieve a better detection rate and lower computation cost. gideon [50] applied a semantic structure to system calls. this approach facilitates the representation of software behavior and obtains excellent results in unm dataset and kd98 dataset. wael et al. [51] presented a heterogeneous detector which consisted of sequence time-delay embedding, hidden markov model [52–54] and a one-class support machine. in addition to satisfactory results, the heterogeneous detector also exhibits the reliability. michael et al. [55] detected features of the system in the hypervisor. the experiments demonstrated that their detection accuracy achieves 90% whilst the method has the detecting ability of dos attacks. the algorithms based on frequency can be realized at a lower computation cost by reducing the dimension of the frequency vectors [56]. svm is sensitive to noises and outliers [57–60]. fsvm is based on fuzzy theory to reduce the influence of noises or outliers on the classification hyperplane [61–66]. lin et al. [67] proposed a method based on the relation between samples and their cluster center. zhang et al. [68] proposed a new fsvm method after considering the imperfection of a distance-based algorithm. however, the above methods also reduce the effect of svs on the hyperplane when reducing the influence of noises or outliers on the hyperplane.  due to human error, random error and other factors in the data collection process, the sample set contains a small number of noise samples. noise samples have a great influence on the construction of the optimal classification hyperplane, which makes it deviate from the optimal position, reduces the normalization ability of the classifier, and affects the classification effect. fsvm assigns different weight coefficients to different samples. the purpose is to make each sample have a different effect on the optimal classification hyperplane.  figure 1 shows the overview of our algorithm. the algorithm consists of three steps. the first step is to obtain the positive and negative minimum hyperspheres based on the training data and svdd. by finding the minimum volume hypersphere containing a sample set, the target samples are included in the hypersphere as much as possible, and the non-target samples are excluded from the hypersphere. the second step is to calculate the distance between the samples and the hyperplanes. the sample position is determined by distance and radius difference. in the third step, different samples inside and outside the hyperspheres are represented by different functions. our algorithm is described in detail below.  figure 1. the overview of the proposed algorithm.  the definition of fuzzy membership function is the key of fsvm algorithm. there are many definitions of fuzzy membership functions, but there are no general guidelines. traditional fuzzy membership functions based on the distance between the sample and its cluster center are not effective appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 5 of 19  to distinguish noises or outliers from svs. sometimes the distance is not the only criterion for judging whether it is normal. as shown in figure 2, point a on the left, in figure 2a, has a high probability of being a valid sample. point a on the right, in figure 2b, has a high probability of being a noise or outlier. it is not enough to just rely on linear functions of distance. the relative position relation between samples should be considered. that is, fuzzy membership function must consider the affinity between samples.  figure 2. the difference of the affinity among samples at two different classes.  as shown in figure 3, the distance between b and the cluster center is not the same as the distance between c and the cluster center. since these two points have the same distance to the classification hyperplane, they contribute the same to the hyperplane. compared with point b and point c, point d is further away from the cluster center, but closer to the classification hyperplane. point d is the point that contributes the most to the hyperplane. so we have to take that into account when we design membership functions.  figure 3. the membership function design based on the position of samples and the hypersphere.  the optimal classification hyperplane and its nearby support vectors are far away from the cluster center. the closer the sample is to the cluster center, the greater the weight coefficient. the noises and svs distributed on the boundary are far from the cluster center. they are all given less weight coefficients. this is quite different from the objective situation. svs should be given greater weight coefficients.  the optimal hyperplane of standard svm is determined by svs. the geometric principle of svm is to use two hyperplanes with maximum spacing to separate the training samples as far as possible in the original space or feature space. therefore, using the hyperplane in class to replace the center can better approximate the actual situation.  the solution of the optimal classification hyperplane of svm is usually converted to solving quadratic programming problem. however, the solving complexity of the quadratic programming problem will increase significantly with the sample increase. when the sample size is large, the traditional fuzzy support vector machine needs large memory to store and calculate the kernel function matrix. therefore, by selecting the boundary vector containing svs in advance, the number appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 6 of 19  of training samples and the number of quadratic programming solutions can be reduced. this has practical significance for improving training speed and accuracy.  3.2. support vector data description  the task of one-class classification is to distinguish the target sample from non-target samples. the boundary has to be constructed by a hypersphere around the target samples. by finding the minimum volume hypersphere containing the sample set, the target samples are included in the hypersphere as much as possible, and the non-target samples are excluded from the hypersphere.  for ease of description, ϕ: rn → h represents the mapping of the input space to the high-dimensional space. assume t = {xi, i=1, 2, · · · , l} contains l data objects, and the hypersphere is described by center a and radius r. the minimum hypersphere can be obtained by solving the following quadratic programming (1).  s.t. ||ϕ(xi) − a|| 2 ≤ r2 + ξi  where ||·|| is the euclidean distance, ξi is slack variables, and c is the trade-off between the volume of the hypersphere and the errors. lagrangian multipliers αi and βi are introduced to construct a lagrangian function. the lagrangian function is constructed as shown in equation (2).  the center a and radius r can be obtained from the solution to the dual problem and the solution to kkt conditions. a and r are calculated according to formulas (3) and (4) respectively.  according to (5), if the euclidean distance between the point ϕ(x) and center a is less than radius r then it is normal. conversely, it is the noise point when the euclidean distance is greater than radius r.  ||ϕ(x) − a|| 2 = k(x, x) − 2σli=1α ∗  3.3. design fuzzy membership function  according to the basic principle of the support vector machine, the optimal classification hyperplane is determined by the support vectors. if each class of the two classification problems is considered as a convex set, then these support vectors lie on the relative boundary of the two convex sets far away from the center of the two classes.  given t = {(xi, yi), i = 1, 2, · · · , l} contains l data objects. if l+ and l− respectively represent the number of positive samples x+i , i = 1, 2, · · · , l  + and the number of negative samples x−i , i = 1, 2, · · · , l −,  then l+ + l−= l. if a+ and a− respectively represent the minimum hypersphere center of positive samples and the  minimum hypersphere center of negative samples, r+ and r− respectively represent the minimum hypersphere radius of positive samples and minimum hypersphere radius of negative samples, then a+  and a− are always located in the geometric center, if the normal vector of the hyperplane is established appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 7 of 19  by the maximum sum of the distance [69] from two centers to the hyperplane. as shown in figure 4, in order to maximize the sum of the distances, it should satisfy d=||a+−a||+||a−−b||≤||a+−o||+||a−−o|| = ||a+−a−||. that is, the distance is maximized d=||a+−a−|| when hyperplane and vector a+−a− are perpendicular to each other.  figure 4. maximize the sum of the distances.  for the given data, the relative positions of the two hyperspheres can be intersected, tangent and separated. the two separate cases and tangent case can be classified as one case. although in the case of intersection, the radial basis kernel function can always choose parameters to make the two hyperspheres separated, this will cause an overfitting phenomenon. therefore, our paper summarizes the above three cases as two cases of separation and intersection.  as shown in the figures 5 and 6, the normal vector to the hyperplane is w = a+− a− according to the principle of maximum distance. these two hyperplanes that go through a+ and a− with a normal vector of a normal vector of w are h+: wt(x−a+) = 0 and h-: wt(x−a−) = 0.  figure 5. the case of separation.  figure 6. the case of intersection. appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 8 of 19  the optimal classification hyperplane is only determined by the svs. therefore, samples can be screened in advance, and those samples that may become support vectors can be selected to be trained as new training samples, which will simplify the computation of quadratic programming and improve the training speed. the optimal classification hyperplane lies between positive and negative hypersphere centers. then, positive and negative samples between h+ and h− can be selected as the new training sample set. as shown in the above two figures, the shaded parts inside the hyperspheres are the normal sample, in which the positive class is represented by orange slashes, while the negative class is represented by blue slashes. the samples with “+” and “*” in the new training sample set located outside the hypersphere represent noises or outliers respectively.  if l+new and l − new are the number of positive and negative samples in the new sample set, then the  distance between the samples and the hyperplane in each class is calculated according to (6). d ( x+i  ||w || , i = 1, 2, · · · , l + new  ) = |wt(x−a−)| ||w || , i = 1, 2, · · · , l  where wt(x−a+) = 0 and h−: wt(x−a−) = 0 are the two hyperplanes that go through a+ and a−; w = a+− a− is the normal vector to the hyperplane.  the distance between the samples and the center of the hypersphere is calculated according to (7). d ( x+i  therefore, membership functions of both positive and negative sample points are constructed according to (8) and (9).  ) ≤ r+, i = 1, 2, · ·

maximum value of the membership function outside the hypersphere is 0.4. the membership value of the sample increases with the value of the distance between the sample and hyperplane. given p ≥ 2, the bigger p, the faster s+i and s  i decay. similarly, for nonlinear cases, mapping function ϕ(x ) is introduced by kernel function k(xi, x j) to map data to a high-dimensional space. the normal vector is w = a+−a− by a rule for the maximum sum of distance from two hyperspheres’ centers to the separation hyperplane. the hyperplanes of the two classes with w as the normal vector and going through a+ and a− respectively are h+: wt(ϕ(x ) − a+) = 0 and h−: wt(ϕ(x ) − a−) = 0. if l+new and l  of positive and negative samples in the new sample set, then the distance between the samples and the

evaluation of our method in terms of detection performance, overhead and impaction of parameters. in order to test the performance of our algorithm, in addition to comparing the svm-based algorithms svm, fsvm1 [66], fsvm2 [65], and fsvm3 [68], the proposed algorithm is also compared with other algorithms in this section.  in order to facilitate an experimental performance comparison with similar studies, the system call datasets unm_sendmail and unm_live_lpr published by the new mexico university are used in this section [70]. the unm_sendmail data set consists of 346 normal traces and 25 abnormal traces. the abnormal data contains sunsendmailcp (sccp) intrusions and decode intrusions, in which the sccp intrusions enable the local user to obtain the root access by using special command options to make sendmail attach an e-mail message to a file, and the decode intrusions enable remote users to make changes to certain files on the local system. data for unm_live_lpr data set includes 15 months of activity and consists of 4298 normal tracks and 1003 abnormal tracks. the abnormal data contains lprcp symbolic link intrusions that take advantage of the vulnerability of the lpr program to control the files on the host computer and tamper with the contents of the files.  the trace consists of a sequence of system calls in chronological order. the meaning of trace varies from program to program. each trace file lists pairs of numbers, the first number represents the process identity (pid) of the execution process, and the second number represents the specific system call (sc). the child processes forked by the parent process are traced individually. we take unm_sendmail as an example to show the specific format of experimental data as follows:  8840 4, 8840 2, 8840 5, 8840 66,

consists of pid and sc. in the experiment, data is segmented according to the pid number and the scs after the same pid are arranged together in chronological order. in the above data, the numbers 8840, 8843 and 6545 are pids and the number 4, appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 10 of 19  2, 5, 66, . . . , 2 are scs. the lists of system calls issued by 8840, 8843 and 6545 are denoted as r8840 = (4, 2, 5, 66, 5, . . . , 6), r8843 = (115, 15, 99, 120, . . . , 17) and r6545 = (2, 55, . . . , 2) respectively.  the vector form of a system call sequence composed of the frequency of the short system call sequences. given n is the number of traces, m is the total number of short system call sequences. then the ith element in the vector is the frequency at which the short system sequence numbered i occurs in the system call sequence of the process. the vector corresponding to the jth trace, represented by the frequency of short system call sequence, is denoted by (f 1j,· · · , f mj). that is to say, samples are represented as (xj, yj) j = 1,· · · , n, where xj = (f 1j,· · · , f mj), yj ∈ (+1, −1).  4.2. the experimental performance  the experimental data of unm_live_lpr process were composed of 4298 normal tracks and 1003 abnormal tracks. the 1003 anomaly traces contain lprcp attacks that control and tamper with host files. the experimental data for the unm_sendmail process consisted of 346 normal traces and 25 abnormal traces, including 20 sccps that used e-mail to obtain root directory information and 5 decode attacks that remotely modified local files.  false alarm is to judge the normal behavior of the program as abnormal behavior. if ln normal traces participate in the evaluation, and nfar normal traces are misjudged as abnormal traces, then the false alarm rate is equal to nfar /ln. detection rate refers to the proportion of detected abnormal traces in the total number of abnormal traces. if lan abnormal traces participate in the test and nhr were detected, then the detection rate is nhr /lan. the missing rate indicates the proportion of unrecognized abnormal traces in the total number of abnormal traces. if lan abnormal traces participate in the evaluation and nm cannot be detected, then the missing rate is nm /lan. dr = ρhr∗(1−ρfar) is used as the comprehensive detection formula, in which ρhr and ρfar stands for detection rate and missing rate respectively.  gauss kernel k (x, y) = exp (−|| x−y ||2/2σ2) is used in all algorithms during training. σ1 and σ2 can be selected according to the maximum error rate allowed in the target set. c1 and c2 can be adjusted according to the equality of upper bound of positive and negative error rate. that is, 1/ l1c1 = 1/ l2c2, 1/ l1≤ c1 ≤ 1, 1/ l2≤ c2 ≤ 1. grid search method is adopted to select the optimal parameters. the search range of parameter c is {2−24, 2−23,· · · , 223, 224}. the parameter σ and β both have a search range of {2−24, 2−23,· · · , 223, 224}. the step length and short sequence length are set to 1 and 6 respectively.  table 1 summarizes the comparison results of detection performance between our method and the other eight methods on unm_live_lp. the detection rate of svm, fsvm1, fsvm2, fsvm3, and our algorithm are 61.53%,76.92%, 76.92%, 83.21%, and 84.61% respectively. the missing rates of svm, fsvm1, fsvm2, fsvm3, and our algorithm are 38.47%, 23.08%, 23.08%, 16.23%, and 15.39% respectively. the false alarm rates of svm, fsvm1, fsvm2, fsvm3, and our algorithm are 10.14%, 9.57%, 8.17%, 6.92%, and 4.51% respectively. in all the algorithms, our algorithm has the highest detection rate and the lowest false alarm rate and missing rate.  table 1. performance comparison on data set unm_live_lp.  algorithm detection rate (%) missing rate (%) false alarm rate (%)  svm 79.88% 20.12% 8.64% fsvm1 83.71% 16.29% 7.30% fsvm2 85.56% 14.44% 8.17% fsvm3 86.20% 13.80% 6.92%  our algorithm 92.63% 7.37% 6.16%  as shown in table 1, svm has the lowest detection rate, 79.88%, among the five algorithms. due to the construction of a fuzzy membership function, the other four algorithms treat the different contributions of different samples in the construction of the objective function differently, which makes their average detection rate reach 87.03%. fsvm1 algorithm designs a fuzzy membership function appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 11 of 19  based on the linear function of the distance between the sample and its cluster center. the larger the distance is, the smaller the coefficients is. however, this membership design method is sometimes unable to distinguish abnormal points effectively. the fsvm2 algorithm not only considers the distance in the fsvm1 algorithm, but also considers the position relation between samples. fsvm2 algorithm determines the membership function according to the position of the sample and hypersphere. when the samples are located inside the hypersphere, the membership function is defined by the linear function of the distance. the coefficient of the sample decreases with the increase of the distance. when the samples are located outside the hypersphere, these samples are regarded as abnormal samples. the membership function is represented by different functions. the fsvm3 algorithm, like the fsvm2 algorithm, takes account of the distance between the sample and its cluster center and the affinity between samples. the difference between the fsvm3 and fsvm2 is that the fsvm3 algorithm is based on the svdd algorithm by introducing two different parameters to control the affinity between positive and negative samples.  the method treats all samples equally during the training process, which makes the contribution of samples to constructing the optimal classification hyperplane equal. as a result, when training samples contain abnormal samples, the classification hyperplane obtained is not the optimal hyperplane. our algorithm abides by the maximum sum of distance from the hypersphere to hyperplane, replaces the cluster center with the hyperplane inside the class, and designs the membership function according to the distance from the sample to the hyperplane inside the hypersphere. therefore, it can be seen from the table that with the continuous improvement of the membership function, the detection rate of the algorithm increases successively. the detection rate changed from 83.71% of fsvm1 algorithm to 85.56% of fsvm2 algorithm, then to 86.20% of wcs-fsvm algorithm, and finally reached 92.63% of our algorithm.  the formula of comprehensive detection rate is closer to reality. the comprehensive detection rates of svm, fsvm1, fsvm2, and fsvm3 are 72.97%, 77.59%, 78.56%, and 80.23% respectively. as show in figure 7, our algorithm has the highest comprehensive detection rate, 86.92%, among five algorithms.  figure 7. performance comparisons on unm_live_lpr data set.  at the same time, it is also evident from the data in table 2 that the detection rate, false alarm rate and missing rate of unm_sendmail data are all lower than that of unm_live_lpr data. the reason for this is the amount of data. the unm_sendmail process data consists of 346 normal tracks and 25 abnormal tracks, which is less experimental data than the 4298 normal tracks and 1003 abnormal tracks of the unm_live_lpr process. therefore, there is sufficient data for unm_live_lpr process training, which is conducive to pre-extracting relative boundary vectors containing enough support vectors and ensuring sufficient data parameters. in the experiments of unm_live_lpr process and unm_sendmail process, svm uses the same error penalty factor for all samples. it will have a negative appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 12 of 19  impact on the classification results when the svm algorithm classifies unbalanced samples. this is the reason that the svm always has the lowest detection rate among all algorithms. fsvm1 algorithm, fsvm2 algorithm, fsvm3 algorithm, and our algorithm are equivalent to using a penalty factor for each sample to be treated differently. when these algorithms are used to classify the quantity imbalance samples, good classification results can be obtained. in other words, membership function can be used to describe error penalty on samples. this is consistent with the conclusion that fuzzy support vector machine is equivalent to a multi-penalty support vector machine.  table 2. performance comparison on data set unm_sendmail.  algorithm detection rate (%) missing rate (%) false alarm rate (%)  svm 61.53% 38.47% 10.14% fsvm1

algorithm, and our algorithm on unm sendmail process data were 55.29%, 69.58%, 70.63%, 77.45%, and 80.79%, respectively. as shown in figure 8, among the five detection algorithms, svm algorithm has the lowest comprehensive detection rate and the weakest detection performance. the algorithm proposed in this paper has the highest comprehensive detection rate and the strongest detection performance. the comprehensive detection performance of fsvm1 algorithm, fsvm2 algorithm and fsvm3 algorithm also varies with the fuzzy membership function, but the overall trend is consistent with the test results obtained from unm_live_lpr process data, that is, the detection performance is improved with the improvement of fuzzy membership function.  figure 8. performance comparisons on unm_sendmail data set.  as shown in tables 3 and 4, the length of the system call short sequence k has a direct impact on the detection performance. when k increases from 3 to 5, the detection rate, missing alarm rate and false alarm rate are increasing. when k is 6, our algorithm obtains the highest detection rate, the lowest false alarm rate and the lowest missing rate. when k is greater than 6, the detection rate of our algorithm starts to decrease, and the missing rate and false alarm rate start to increase. on unm_sendmail data, the detection rate, false alarm rate, and missing alarm rate of pvfsvm algorithm have the same trend as on unm_live_lpr data. appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 13 of 19  table 3. detection performance of different k on unm_live_lpr data.  our method k = 3 k = 4 k

unm_sendmail are 86.92% and 80.79% respectively, which are higher than the comprehensive detection rate corresponding to other k values on unm_live_lpr and unm_sendmail. when k increases from 3 to 6, the comprehensive detection rate also increases gradually. when k increases from 6 to 8, the comprehensive detection rate decreases gradually.  figure 9. the comprehensive detection rate of different k on unm_live_lpr data.  figure 10. the comprehensive detection rate of different k on unm_sendmail data. appl. sci. 2020, 10, 1065 14 of 19  this is consistent with professor forrest’s conclusion on the selection of short sequence length, and professor wenke lee’s conclusion from the perspective of information theory that the best system call short sequence length is 6 or 7. compared with the value of k of 6, when the value of short sequence is too small, the timing relation between short sequence patterns is lost. when the short sequence becomes longer, the short sequence pattern loses local information, no matter what kind of information loss will make the comprehensive detection performance worse. therefore, the short sequence length can only be chosen as 6, which makes the detection performance of our algorithm reach the optimal level.  table 5 summarizes the comparison results of detection performance between our method and the other eight methods on unm_live_lp. the

respectively consider the detection problem from the aspect of data reversibility and similarity matching degree, and fail to consider the sequence characteristics between system calls. therefore, they are the two algorithms with the worst comprehensive detection performance. the ipma method and hybrid markov method are complicated due to investigating the transition characteristics of system calls one by one. although the ρfar of ipma method and hybrid markov method are 7.58% and 14.26%, the ρmr is 47.37% and 40.22%. the ρmr of bayes 1-step markov method is 33.3% and the ρfar is 4.1%. the comprehensive test performance evaluation formula has a high value, so the test performance is good. since this method looks the frequency of rare system calls, the ρmr of uniqueness method is 55.3%

calculation, but the false alarm rate is too high. therefore, the comprehensive detection performance is good. the closeness method extracts user behavior patterns from the perspective of combination. it shows good detection performance under different closeness thresholds, but it ignores the characteristics of attack intensity. that is, the attacker will complete the attack task in the shortest possible time and try to behave normally the rest of the time. as show in figure 11, our algorithm has the highest comprehensive detection rate 86.92% among five algorithms. in all the algorithms, our

of different algorithms on unm_sendmail.  in order to solve the defects of fsvm. this paper presents a new fsvm algorithm based on svdd. in our method, the noises and outliers are identified by a hypersphere with minimum volume while containing the maximum of the samples. the definition of fuzzy membership considered not only the position of samples inside the hypersphere, but also the distance between the hyperplane and samples. for the samples inside the hypersphere, the fuzzy membership function is a linear function of the distance. the greater the distance is, the greater the coefficient is. for the samples outside the hypersphere, the fuzzy membership function is an exponential function of the distance. the greater the distance is, the smaller the coefficient is. compared with the fsvm based on the relation between the sample and its cluster center, our algorithm effectively distinguishes the noises or outliers from samples. the experiments show that our fsvm is more robust than the svm and fsvm based on the distance between the sample and its cluster center. our algorithm is suitable for the data of system call sequence and can contribute to accurate prediction.
